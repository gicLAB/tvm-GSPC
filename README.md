# TVM-GSPC: Optimizing Grouped Convolutions on Edge Devices

**UPDATE** an improved version of the GSPC implementation is now [merged into the main TVM tree](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6137).  This is the prefered version to use.

Modified TVM codebase to add support for Grouped Spatial Pack Convolution (GSPC).

Testing in a Debian 10 GNU/Linux Bash environment.

To run a TVM workload using GSPC on x86 and ARM platforms, set the environment variable `TVM_USE_GSPC` to true.  For remote devices, this codebase, or `master` TVM commit `95e06b3ec9` are known to work.

For installation details [see the TVM documentation](https://docs.tvm.ai/install/from_source.html#install-from-source).
